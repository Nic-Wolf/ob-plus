# Obsidian Default Theme... PLUS!

This theme is built on top of the default css for obsidian. I prefer the OEM obsidian theme, but I wanted more purple... but not TOO much purple!

This will give you just enough purple.

## Installation

1. Download this repo.
2. Copy the `OB+` folder, and paste it into your vault's themes folder.
    eg: `Documents/your_notebook_vault/.obsidian/themes/`
3. Open the **Settings** in Obsidian.
4. Navigate to **Appearances** tab under **Options**.
5. Under the **Themes** section, click on the dropdown menu next to **Theme** heading.
6. Select `ob-plus` and then you're done!
