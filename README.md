# Obsidian Default Theme... PLUS!

This theme is built on top of the default css for obsidian. I prefer the OEM obsidian theme, but I wanted more purple... but not TOO much purple!

This will give you just enough purple.

## Installation

1. Download this repo.
1. Copy the `ob-plus.css` file into your vault's `/.obsidian/themes` directory.
1. Open the **Settings** in Obsidian.
1. Navigate to **Appearances** tab under **Options**.
1. Under the **Themes** section, click on the dropdown menu next to **Theme** heading.
1. Select `ob-plus` and then you're done!
